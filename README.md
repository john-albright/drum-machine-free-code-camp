# Drum Machine

This React.js project was created to complete the third of five projects for Free Code Camp's third certificate [Front End Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries). The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The audio files used for the project were taken from [Zander Jaz](https://www.zanderjaz.com/downloads/drum-kits/).
